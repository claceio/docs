summary: "Configuration options for the Clace server and client."
---

Most configuration options specified in the following sections are for the Clace server. The Clace client CLI, which talks with the Clace server using unix domain sockets, uses a small subset of the config properties. If the Clace client runs on the same machine as the server, then the same config file can be used for both. See [here]({{< ref "security/#admin-api-access" >}}) for details.
