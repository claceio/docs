Clace is an open-source project which aims to make it easy for individuals and teams to develop and manage lightweight full stack web applications in a secure manner. The applications can have an auto generated form interface or a fully customized UI. Clace provides integrations to enable SSO/SAML based authentication and authorization controls, audit logs and integration with secrets manager for managing credentials. Applications run in a security sandbox, enabling admins to control what actions can be performed by the app.
