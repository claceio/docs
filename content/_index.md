Clace makes it possible to easily build and share webapps exposing CLI tools and API points. Clace implements an AppServer allowing management of containerized web apps written in any language/framework. Clace is cross-platform across Linux/Windows/OSX." style="background: radial-gradient(ellipse at 50% 80%,rgba(89, 67, 7, 0.15),hsla(0,0%,100%,0));" >}}

<!-- prettier-ignore --> {{< hextra/feature-card title="How does it work?" subtitle="Clace builds webapps based on app specification, without requiring any frontend code to be written. Clace also implements a language/framework agnostic application server. Clace combines the functionality of a reverse proxy and a container orchestrator (using Docker or Podman) in a single lightweight binary, providing a GitOps interface for app management." style="background: radial-gradient(ellipse at 50% 80%,rgba(89, 67, 7, 0.15),hsla(0,0%,100%,0));" >}}

Apps built in low-code frameworks like Streamlit/Gradio/FastHTML etc can be easily deployed using Clace. For all deployed apps, Clace provides GitOps, blue-green staged deployment, OAuth access control, TLS cert management, secrets management etc." style="background: radial-gradient(ellipse at 50% 80%,rgba(89, 67, 7, 0.15),hsla(0,0%,100%,0));" >}}

<!-- prettier-ignore --> {{< hextra/feature-card title="Comparison with other tools" subtitle="Open source PaaS solutions are built on top of reverse proxies (Traefik/Nginx) and work on Linux only.

Compared to other AppServers, Clace supports all languages and does not require any code changes in the app. Running in containers gives better isolation across apps.
